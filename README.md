**This mod was originally an update/rewrite of SorryLate's *Save Game Options* mod (found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5190)), but has been rewritten from scratch.** It incorporates much more functionality than the original, and works better overall.

#### Installation
1. Install [the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.
